# Life Before The End

**Life Before The End** is a project dedicated to exploring current research works towards helping Indigenous communities, their culture, and language through technology. This project compiles various scientific works, primarily those that use artificial intelligence and machine learning. In addition, our goal is to increase awareness and understanding of Indigenous cultures by providing a platform that highlights the rich history, traditions, and ongoing struggles of these communities.

## Project Description

The title "Life Before The End" is inspired by a Brazilian podcast episode, ["Vida Depois do Fim" (Life After the End)](https://radionovelo.com.br/originais/apresenta/vida-depois-do-fim/) from "Rádio Novelo", that explores the extermination of an Indigenous group known as the "Índio do Buraco" (Man of the Hole). 

The project aims to serve as an open-source tool for sharing knowledge about Indigenous peoples worldwide, providing references and resources for those interested in learning more about them. It also aims to be a resource for scientists actively working towards the progress of Indigenous communities.
